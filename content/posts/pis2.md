**1. Please describe your typical daily routine.**

{{< audio src="/audio/PIS2-01.mp3">}}

> My daily routine is **pretty standard**. I usually wake up early, **get dressed**, eat breakfast, and then **head off to** work or school. In the evenings, I'll usually **do some studying** or hang out with friends. But sometimes I feel like **I'm stuck in a rut** with the same old routine, and it can get **pretty tedious**.
