## Gifts

**Do you often give gifts to people?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-01.mp3" >}}

> Every now and then. Definitely not something I do all the time. **But I know there are people who** love to give gifts **on a regular basis**, especially during special occasions.

**Do you ever receive gifts?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-02.mp3" >}}

> Yes, I do. **I appreciate it when** people take the time to think of something special to give me. It's **a nice surprise** and a way to show that someone cares about me.

**What's the best gift you've ever received?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-03.mp3" >}}

> That's a tough question. I've received some really **thoughtful gifts** in the past that **mean a lot to** me. **One that stands out in my mind is** a beautiful **bouquet of flowers** that a friend gave me on my birthday. It was a really nice **token of appreciation**.

**Do you and your family members give each other gifts?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-04.mp3" >}}

> Yes, we do exchange gifts with each other, especially during holidays and special occasions. We usually give each other something **small and thoughtful**, rather than anything **excessive**.

**What sorts of gifts do you give to your family and friends?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-05.mp3" >}}

> It depends on the person and the occasion. **When it comes to** my family, I usually try to think of something that they would really **appreciate** and enjoy. For my friends, I might give them something fun or something that reflects our shared interests.

**Do you think it's easy to choose what to give other people?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-06.mp3" >}}

> It can be both easy and difficult, depending on the person. I know there are people who are really hard to buy gifts for because they seem to have everything they need. In those cases, I try to come up with something more creative or **personalized**.

**Do you think it's important to give expensive gifts?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-07.mp3" >}}

> Yeah maybe. **But this is not always the case though**. I think **it's the thought that counts**, rather than the cost of the gift. **The same can be said for** when I receive gifts. I appreciate a thoughtful, inexpensive gift just as much as I would an expensive one.

**Have you ever given someone a gift you made yourself?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-08.mp3" >}}

> Yes, I have. I think it's a really special and personal way to show someone that you care about them. It takes a little bit more effort and thought, but it can be **a really meaningful gesture**.

## Entertainment

**What types of entertainment do you like?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-09.mp3" >}}

> I enjoy **a wide range of** entertainment. I like to watch movies, read books, and listen to music. I also enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and going to the beach.

**What did you do for entertainment when you were a child?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-10.mp3" >}}

> When I was a child, I spent a lot of time playing outside with my friends. We **would** ride bikes, play sports, and explore the neighborhood. On rainy days, we **would** play board games or watch movies.

**When you were a child, what places did you go to for entertainment?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-11.mp3" >}}

> Well, I enjoyed going to the library to borrow books or to the local amusement park for some rides and games. On special occasions, my family **would** go to the movies or to a local festival or fair.

**What do people do for entertainment around where you live?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-12.mp3" >}}

> Well, let me see... I think they often go to movie theaters, malls, and restaurants **for entertainment**. On the other hand, there are also plenty of parks and outdoor **recreational areas** where people can go to **unwind and enjoy themselves**. But there are people who prefer more **low-key forms of entertainment**, like reading or spending time with friends and family.

**What choices for entertainment are there for young people around where you live?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-13.mp3" >}}

> There are many **options**. For example, there are **plenty of** clubs, bars, and music venues that **cater to** a younger crowd. There are also more **wholesome** options like sports teams, community events, and museums.

**Have you recently been to any place for entertainment?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-14.mp3" >}}

> In the past week, I haven't gone to any places specifically for entertainment. However, I **did** go to a friend's house and we watched a movie together, which was a nice way to unwind and enjoy ourselves.

**What did you do for entertainment in the past week?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-15.mp3" >}}

> Hmm... I watched a few movies and TV shows that I had been wanting to see. I also went out with some friends to a new restaurant that had just opened in town. We **had a great time** trying out all the different dishes and chatting.

**Is there any form of entertainment that you'd like to try in the future?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis3-16.mp3" >}}

> There are definitely a few forms of entertainment that **are on my list of things** to try **at some point in the future**. For example, I've always wanted to go skydiving or bungee jumping. **Down the line**, I would also like to **try my hand at** painting or pottery. **When it comes to** entertainment, I'm always open to trying new things and having new experiences.
