## Daily routine

**Please describe your typical daily routine.**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-01.mp3" >}}

> My daily routine is **pretty standard**. I usually wake up early, **get dressed**, eat breakfast, and then **head off to** school. In the evenings, I'll usually **do some studying** or hang out with friends. But sometimes I feel like **I'm stuck in a rut** with the same old routine, and it can get **pretty tedious**.

**Do you like to plan what you will do each day?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-02.mp3" >}}

> I like to have a general plan for my day, but I also like to **leave room for flexibility**. It helps me stay organized and productive, but sometimes I feel like I **have too much on my plate** and **things can get overwhelming**.

**What's usually your busiest time of the day?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-03.mp3" >}}

> My afternoons are usually pretty busy, with classes **back to back**. It's my busiest time of the day.

**How do you organize your study time?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-04.mp3" >}}

> To **stay on top of** my studies, I try to **set aside** specific times for working on different tasks, and I break larger tasks into smaller chunks. It helps me stay focused and avoid **getting overwhelmed**.

**What time of the day are you the most efficient?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-05.mp3" >}}

> I'm usually most productive in the morning, when I'm **well-rested** and energized.

**Is your life now the same as it was before?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-06.mp3" >}}

> **Essentially** it is, with a few small changes **here and there**. I've **taken up some new hobbies** and, you know, added some exercise into my routine, but the rest hasn't really changed much.

**If you had more free time, what would you do?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-07.mp3" >}}

> **I'd probably** spend it doing things I enjoy, like reading, traveling, or hanging out with friends and family.

**Do you think there will be any changes to your routine in the near future?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-08.mp3" >}}

> I don't think so. I'm focusing on my studies and **have a pretty full schedule with** classes, assignments, and part-time work. But I **do** expect my routine to be **drastically different** once I graduate and start working full-time.

## Weather

**What kind of weather do you like best?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-09.mp3" >}}

> I really like cool, **refreshing** weather, like a **crisp** autumn day. The cool air is **invigorating** and refreshing, and it's the perfect temperature for being outside and enjoying all the fun things.

**What kind of weather do you dislike?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-10.mp3" >}}

> **I'm not a fan of** weather that's too hot or too cold, like **scorching hot** summers or **freezing cold** winters.

**How often is the weather good where you live?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-11.mp3" >}}

> The weather where I live is pretty **predictable**, with **distinct seasons** and a mix of good and bad days. But sometimes the weather **can be a bit of a wild card**.

**Have you ever been to any place where the weather is different to your place?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-12.mp3" >}}

> Yeah, I have. For example, I've been to places with really cold winters. Like last year I went to Hanoi and it was so cold that my skin felt really dry and itchy. **Not exactly my cup of tea**.

**Does the weather ever affect what you do?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-13.mp3" >}}

> It definitely does, especially when it's **extreme**. If it's scorching hot out, I might not want to be outside for too long, or if it's freezing cold, I'll need to **bundle up** before going out.

**Do you often pay attention to the weather forecast?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-14.mp3" >}}

> I do **check the weather forecast**, especially if I'm planning to do something outdoors or if I need to prepare for any potential weather-related issues. **The last thing I want** is to **be caught off guard by** a sudden rainstorm or a heatwave.

**In your country, are there ever any problems caused by the weather?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-15.mp3" >}}

> Absolutely. We have storms, flooding and other natural disasters. In the middle part of our country, there are often **typhoons** that cause significant damage. In the south, we have to deal with floods during the rainy season.

**Would you prefer to live in a place that has just one, warm season that lasts the whole year, or a place with different seasons?**

{{< audio src="/audio/pis2-16.mp3" >}}

> **Personally, I'd rather** live in a place with different seasons, because I enjoy the variety and the changes that come with each season. **But I can see why someone might** prefer a place with a consistent, warm climate, as long as it's not too humid or stifling.
